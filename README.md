# portfolio-generator

## Description 
I created a command line application that generates a ReadMe for the user. The user is presented with a series of prompted questions that regard to setting up the ReadMe. Once the user answers all of the questions, their answers will be displayed on the ReadMe preview generator. I also included a badge which displays the user's last commit to a specific repo on their GitHub account. 

## Installation

## Usage 
This application was created by using JavaScript and node.js. 

- Open index.js
- Open intergated terminal 
- Enter node index.js
